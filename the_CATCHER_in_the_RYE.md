# The CATCHER in the RYE

1. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HEAR about it, the first thing you'll probably want to
   know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my
   parents were occupied **and all** before they had me, **and all** that
   David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you
   want to know the truth.  

2. I remember around three o'clock that afternoon I was **standing way** the hell
   up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the
   Revolutionary War and all.
3. The more expensive a school is, the more **crooks** it has —— I'm not kidding.  
4. I mean I've left schools and places I didn't **even** know I was leaving them. I
   hate that.
5. "**How've you been**, Mrs. Spencer?" I said again, only louder, so she'd hear
   me.
